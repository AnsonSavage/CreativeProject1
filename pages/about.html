      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; I am! I'm a Freshman (Junior?) studying Computer Science (pre-animation) at BYU!
        I enjoy making beautiful art with <a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>! Blender is just about the coolest open source project ever created, by the way.
      </p>
      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; I also enjoy running, playing the piano, and programming of course! I have an awesome family that does awesome stuff sometimes.
      </p>
      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; I strongly dislike beaucracy.
      </p>
      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; When I was in 7th grade, I was struck with an overwhelming desire to create lightsaber special effects.
        And so, that's what I did. I opened up Blender, tried really hard my whole Spring Break to make it work, to no avail.
        So, I closed Blender and didn't touch it for a whole year...
      </p>
      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; The end.
      </p>
      <p class="longDescription">
        &emsp; Except, then I picked it up again a year later to try to make a 3D logo, because that's what 8th graders need to do sometimes.
        And then I couldn't put Blender down, because it's glorious. But I got kind of compulsive and only did homework, so I really only worked on Blender when school wasn't happening.
        Which was a serious sin. You should never let homework get in the way of your dreams.
